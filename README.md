# Employee Management System

## Project Description

The Employee Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline and automate the management of employees, departments, payroll, attendance, leave requests, and other HR functions for small to medium-sized organizations. This system enables the HR team to maintain accurate and up-to-date information on employees while also offering employees an easy-to-use interface for self-service functions such as attendance tracking and leave management.

This project is built using front-end technologies like HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, with JSON serving as the storage mechanism. The system provides secure access with login, signup, and validation features to ensure that only registered employees can access the platform.

## Key Features

- Employee Management: Add, update, and manage employee records, including personal details, department assignment, and role information.
- Department Management: Maintain and update department details, manage departmental hierarchy.
- Payroll Management: Automatic calculation of net salary based on base salary, tax deductions, and benefits.
- Attendance Tracking: Record employee check-in and check-out times with date, allowing HR to track working hours and overtime.
- Leave Management: Employees can apply for leaves online, and administrators can approve or deny requests.
- Secure Authentication: Login, signup, and logout functionalities with form validation, ensuring that only registered users can access the system.
- Responsive Design: The system is fully responsive and accessible on multiple devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
- Contact Form: Integrated contact form with embedded Google Maps for location.
- Modern User Interface: Uses Bootstrap for a clean and professional look.
